How GitHub works
--------------------

Local repo and Remote repo interacts each other to maintain source code update



add, commit and push from Local Repo to Remote Repo

git add : first step to initiate the changes from local repo to remote repo

git commit -m : second step to put the changes from local repo to remote repo

git push : final step to push the changes to the remote repo
